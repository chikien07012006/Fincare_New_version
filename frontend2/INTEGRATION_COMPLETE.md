## 📝 Notes

### What's Not Included (Intentional):
- CSV upload/processing for bank statements (keeping manual entry for now)
- Ownership data entry (structure ready, skipped per requirements)
- File upload UI integration (placeholder exists)
- Software integration UI (placeholder exists)

### Known Limitations:
- No CSV parser for bank statements yet (manual entry works)
- No file upload validation beyond file type
- Analysis regenerates if user revisits after data changes
